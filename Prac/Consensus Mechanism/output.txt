[PoW] Proof of Work Consensus:
Validator power levels: {'Miner Alice': 96, 'Miner Bob': 83, 'Miner Carol': 6}
Selected: Miner Alice (highest computational power: 96)
Logic: The miner with the highest hash power wins the right to add the block.

[PoS] Proof of Stake Consensus:
Validator stakes: {'Staker Alice': 566, 'Staker Bob': 164, 'Staker Carol': 855}
Selected: Staker Carol (highest stake: 855)
Logic: The staker with the most coins staked is most likely to be chosen.

[DPoS] Delegated Proof of Stake Consensus:
Voter choices: {'Voter1': 'Alice', 'Voter2': 'Alice', 'Voter3': 'Charlie'}
Vote counts: {'Alice': 2, 'Bob': 0, 'Charlie': 1}
Selected delegate: Alice
Logic: Delegates are voted in by token holders. The most-voted delegate validates the block.
