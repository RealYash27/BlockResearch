Merkle Root & Data Integrity
The Merkle Root is a single hash that summarizes all transactions in a block using a Merkle Tree. 
Each transaction is hashed, then pairs of hashes are combined and hashed again, recursively, until one final root hash remains.

It helps verify data integrity by enabling quick and efficient validation that the data has not been altered. 
If any transaction within the block is changed, the Merkle root will also change, signaling that the data has been tampered with.
 This allows nodes to confirm the integrity of the entire dataset without checking every individual transaction.
