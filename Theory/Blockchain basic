Blockchain is an immutable decentralized ledger which records and stores transactions in a transparent, secure and tamper-proof way,
These transactions are stored in blocks, these blocks are hashed with the transactions in it,
These hashes of block is connected to the previous block, making a merkle tree,
So in order to tamper any block, the hashes of all previous blocks need to be changed which is mathematically impossible.

And unlike traditional DB, which is controlled by a central authority,
 blockchain is a p2p network in which every user has a copy of the ledger and users agree to reach consensus to decide the state of blockchain.
